# Data transmission

This repository shows the code for data transmission using one 
to one or multiple devices to one using an Attiny85, an Arduino 
Nano, and an NRF24L01 transceptor.

The  connection instructions (and hacks used) are available on the 
*instructions* folder, there are python codes in some folders
for the validation of my frequency sampler (and transmitter), 
the visualization of  the signal (both in frequency and time).

This code was partialy migrated to https://github.com/ithallojunior/sEMG-device.
